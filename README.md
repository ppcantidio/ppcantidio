# Pedro Cantidio

Co-founder & CPTO at **Spryx**.  
I build AI-native SaaS systems with a focus on backend architecture, multi-tenant platforms, identity/authorization, and product execution.

## What I’m building
- AI agent platform for business workflows at Spryx
- Multi-tenant architecture (B2B2B), RBAC/ABAC, secure auth
- Scalable backend services in Python (FastAPI), Postgres, Redis, and cloud infrastructure
- Operational foundations: observability, CI/CD, reliability, and developer experience
